### About
This application is a blog application that I built along with the
**Udemy Course Rails 5 BDD with Rspec and Capybara**

I've also integrated the repository with code climate to leverage their code climate, and test reporter resources.

This was built as a learning experience to help me improve my rails development
workflow.
